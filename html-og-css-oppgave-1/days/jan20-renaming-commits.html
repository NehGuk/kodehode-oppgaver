        <h1>Renaming previous commits</h1>
        <p>
          First things first: always make sure to write clear and consistent
          commit messages. However, things may go wrong at times. Silly typos,
          meaningless messages, inconsistent verb tenses. There's a lot we may
          want to improve. Today I played around with the infamous
          <code>git rebase -i HEAD~N</code>
          strategy. What the heck is that? This allows us to edit commit
          messages that have already been pushed to our repository. This is how
          it works:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">
                git rebase -i HEAD~3
            </code></pre>
        <p>
          This will allow you to edit the last 3 commits. Use any number you
          wish here, as long as it's equal or smaller than the total number of
          commits of your project. The system will bring up a file with all the
          commit messages: for the ones you wanna change, just replace
          <code>pick</code> by <code>reword</code>. Then save it and close the
          document. A new file will open up, where you're finally able to edit
          the commit message. Again, save and close. Repeat the process for
          every commit message you wish to edit. Once you're done, proceed with
          the final trick:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">
                git push --force origin
            </code></pre>
        <p>
          That's basically it. More details on the official docs
          <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message#rewriting-the-most-recent-commit-message"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >. An important note: it's best to avoid doing this in projects where
          several developers are working on the same repo. A poorly planned
          rebase will almost certainly be a major headache for the whole team ––
          because everything will go out of sync, and everyone in the team will
          hate you.
